# RNA-seq

How can I analyse my RNA-seq data to investigate differential gene expression? 


RNA-seq is often used to examine the genes expressed under two experimental conditions. If a gene is important for tolerating a particular condition, that gene may be highly expressed. Thus, there will be more copies of the gene's RNA transcript in that condition.
