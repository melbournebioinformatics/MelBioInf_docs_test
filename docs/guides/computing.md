# Computing platforms and infrastructure

There are several options for data analysis and data storage. 


## Your local computer

Install and run tools locally. 

Melbourne Bioinformatics has written tutorials for a few key tools, and we also run workshops throughout the year. For additional workshops, see [Research Platforms](http://research.unimelb.edu.au/infrastructure/research-platform-services#training).

We recommend these tutorials to get started: 

- [Unix](../tutorials/unix/index.md)
- [Python](../tutorials/python_overview/python_overview.md)
- [Git](../tutorials/using_git/Using_Git.md)
- [Docker](../tutorials/docker/docker.md)


## The Galaxy Platform 

Galaxy is a free, web-based bioinformatics platform. See our full guide [here](galaxy.md). 


## Launch a Linux machine in the cloud

Use a virtual machine. 

For example, you could use the Genomics Virtual Lab (the GVL) in the Nectar cloud.

- [Nectar: https://nectar.org.au](https://nectar.org.au/about/)


## A high performance computer (cluster)

Melbourne Bioinformatics runs large clusters on which researchers can run analyses. 

For detailed information see the documentation [here](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/documentation/).

## Data storage

Large datasets may be difficult to store (and share) on your local computer. 

An alternative option is using storage on the Nectar cloud. 

- Nectar is an Australian organization that provides a cloud for data storage and analysis. 
- Nectar link: [nectar.org.au](https://nectar.org.au/about/)
- Click [here](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/6000134520) for information about storage options and tools on Nectar. 
- Click [here](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055382-introduction-to-cloud-storage) for an introduction to cloud storage on Nectar. 

<!-- not including GenomeSpace until it has been fully tested 

- GenomeSpace is a web interface that provides links between data storage and platforms: [GenomeSpace tutorial](../tutorials/genomespace/genomespace.md).
