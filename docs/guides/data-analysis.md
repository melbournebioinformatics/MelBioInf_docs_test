# How can I analyse my data?


## The Galaxy Platform 

To analyse data, we recommend getting started with Galaxy - a free, web-based bioinformatics platform. See our full guide [here](galaxy.md).


## Your local computer

Install and run tools locally. We recommend these tutorials to get started: 

- [Unix](../tutorials/unix/index.md)
- [Python](../tutorials/python_overview/python_overview.md)
- [Git](../tutorials/using_git/Using_Git.md)
- [Docker](../tutorials/docker/docker.md)

## Launch a Linux machine in the cloud

Use a virtual machine. 

For example, you could use the Genomics Virtual Lab (the GVL) in the Nectar cloud.

## A high performance computer (cluster)

Check this section with Andrew Isaac


Melbourne Bioinformatics runs large clusters on which (unimelb only?) researchers can run analyses.
