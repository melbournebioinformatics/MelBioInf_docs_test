# What is bioinformatics?

Bioinformatics is the analysis of biologial data using computational methods. It includes the study of genes and genomes, RNA, proteins and metabolites. 

## Getting started

- Look at our guides on the left for a general introduction to several key topics in bioinformatics. 

- Underneath the guides, there are groups of tutorials for common tasks in bioinformatics. 

- To analyse data, we recommend getting started with [Galaxy](galaxy.md) - a free, web-based bioinformatics platform.
